## Software description
This repository contains all the needed classes to reproduce the experiments explained in the paper. The software contains the following packages:

### Algorithms
The software includes the implementation of several contact recommendation approaches which are used in our experiments.

#### Information Retrieval Models for contact recommendation

#### Friends of friends algorithms for contact recommendation

Next, we include a table including the different parameter configurations we have selected for the experiments in our paper. We include these configurations in the `conf` folder. The notation followed is the same as the one indicated in the previous formulas.
